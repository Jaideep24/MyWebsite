It is the perfect destination for you and your family to spend a day skating and sledging on ice, throwing snowballs at each other and enjoy the very realistic snowfall in the Snow Dance arena. To go with the theme of the park and to provide guests with a very authentic feel of land covered in snow, the temperature is kept at -10°C - an exciting contrast from the weather conditions Mumbai gets, even in winter. Take your family to Snow World, Mumbai expecting a fun-filled time in the chilled indoor chambers frolicking in the ice and snow, and you will not be disappointed. The ambience, as well as the different activities on the card, will make your visit a special and memorable experience. It doesn’t hurt that Snow World takes safety precautions very seriously and there are guides everywhere to assist you with the different activities so that you can enjoy them to the fullest without worrying about anything else.</p>
