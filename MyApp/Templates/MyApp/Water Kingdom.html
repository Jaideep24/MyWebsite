<p style="opacity: 0;animation: mymove 1s ; position: relative; animation-delay:2s; animation-fill-mode:forwards">After Essel world comes its neighbouring water park, the Water Kingdom.Believed to be Asia's largest theme water park, the Water Kingdom is an enormous family-friendly water cum amusement park in Mumbai. Boasting of a number of small and large pools and featuring speed modulated slides, pool waves, lazy river etc, the park is a big hit among the kids and the adults. In addition to that, you can also opt for a fish pedicure on the premises. For kids and adults like the Water Kingdom is a welcome respite from the heat and hassles of Mumbai.It is located in Borivali West, on the Global Pagoda Road.Being next to Essel world, this water park shares walls with it and it would seem as if one could jump from one park to the other given very high jumping capabilities. It can be easily reached via a combination of rail and road transport. The highlights of the Water Kingdom are undoubtedly its rides and stellar facilities. It is a great destination to experience with family, friends as well as loved ones.
